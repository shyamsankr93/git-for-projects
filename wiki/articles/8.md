The input zones manage all the incoming data of the project.

The first one is called [Input Data](flow_zone:yfePaaY) and contains the datasets listed in the [Data Model article](article:13). These datasets can be linked through the [Project Setup](article:6). They are the source data used throughout the flow.

In the [Extra Financial Feed](flow_zone:kLHDojR) zone, the news are prepared. In the group recipe, titles are concatenated to have only one line per stock and day. And finally a prepare recipe processes the text to normalize, stem and clear stop words, and parse dates.

The [Real Time Data](flow_zone:gG9qKCC) zone is very similar to the [Extra Financial Feed](flow_zone:kLHDojR). The same aggregation and preparation is done to create the dataset to score stocks [news_today_grouped_scored](dataset:news_today_grouped_scored). And news are also processed without grouping to score them individually in [news_today_prepared](dataset:news_today_prepared).
