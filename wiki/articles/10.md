In the zone [Cross Data Analysis](flow_zone:3795QRj), the news and the anomaly detection data are joined and a model is learned to predict anomalousness using the news. In the prepare recipe, rows with no news are removed and aggregated news are cleared of the ticker. Then the model is trained using as features only the news which are processed with count vectorization. The algorithm finally chosen is the logistic regression for its good performance, simplicity, stability and interpretability ([News Score Model](saved_model:lu8Ph7Ob), [Full report of model News Score Model](insight:RwBQsO4)).
