The Case Study tab lets the user navigate through the past anomalies detected by the algorithm and visualize the price evolution and the news with their scores around the anomaly.

At the top of the screen, a table with the list of anomalies is displayed. It contains its date and the stock ticker concerned. The user can click on one of its lines and he will get the following views focused on this detected anomaly.

The final table compiles the news that were published between 3 days before and after the anomalous day. The last column is the score that the model has computed on the news. It can happen that no news events were published on a detected anomaly.
