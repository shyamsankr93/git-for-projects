This project creates a [webapp](web_app:0a0bFw3) to allow easy access to the results of the analysis. The user will be able to follow in real time the tickers they selected and investigate some specific cases thanks to the interactive interface. The webapp is made of four tabs:

- [Real Time News Scoring](article:15): to visualize the alerts in real time
- [Case Study](article:16): to investigate past anomalies
- [Historical Price Anomaly Detection](article:17): to plot the price evolution
- [Historical News Scoring](article:18): to explore past news and their scores
