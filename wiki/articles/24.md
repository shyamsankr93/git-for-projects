# Context
When managing stock portfolios of hundreds or thousands of stocks, it is necessary but challenging or impossible to follow the news happening for each of them: the volume of potentially market-moving information is too large to handle manually. In this project news headlines are pulled and linked with market data to learn which news items are most impactful. As a result of this model, fresh news headlines loaded in real time are linked with firms in the market and transformed into volatility scores. This score enables the user to focus on the stocks deemed more likely to exhibit anomalous moves as a result.

# Outline
The project is split in different parts: 
- [Analysis of the market prices to pinpoint the anomalous moves](article:12)
- [Data Model](article:13)
- [Cross Data Analysis](article:14)
