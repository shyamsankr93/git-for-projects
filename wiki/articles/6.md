The Project Setup enables the user to input the list of tickers on which the analysis will be done and to select the input datasets. Once these inputs are specified by the user, a button triggers a scenario that builds the whole flow.

In the first tile, the user is asked to provide the datasets that are described in this [article](article:13). The project is delivered with existing data, but the user can put their own and then automate the project so that the outputs are always up-to-date.

Then a firts button allows the user to build the flow. It will run the [Overnight Batch](scenario:Overnight_Batch) which builds the flow. The next button runs the alert scoring through the scenario [Real Time Risk Scoring](scenario:Real_Time_Risk_Scoring). Then the user can activate the [Scenarios](article:7) triggers to keep the [Stock Alert System Dashboard](web_app:0a0bFw3) up-to-date.
