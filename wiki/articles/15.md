The first tab, Real Time News Scoring, is the most interesting output of the project. It gives in real time the volatility score per stock and also lets the user browse through the news of the day.
 
At the top of the view, a table compiles the scores for the stocks that were mentioned in the news today. The last update time is indicated under the title. The table is sorted by default in descending volatility score order, meaning that the top rows contain the stocks that are most likely to have anomalous behaviour. The user can also select a stock in the dropdown menu to focus on it, if some news has been reported associated with this stock.

The user can select any row in the first table, and it will filter the news that are in the second table. A news title can be associated with more than one stock, as can be seen in the Stocks column. The user can then read the full article by clicking on the news title.

This whole view is reset at midnight UTC, when the Overnight Batch finishes running, so in the morning it can be a bit empty. It will get updated each time the Real Time Risk Scoring scenario runs.
